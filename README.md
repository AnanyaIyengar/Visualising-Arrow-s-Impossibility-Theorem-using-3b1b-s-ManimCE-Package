# Visualising-Arrow-s-Impossibility-Theorem-using-3b1b-s-ManimCE-Package

I used 3b1b's open source Community Edition of MANIM on Python to intuitively explain Arrow's Impossibility Theorem: a popular theorem in Social Choice that analytically proposes that the "ideal" necessities of a good social choice rule: the Weak Pareto Principle, Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, Unrestricted Domain, Ordering and Non-Dictatorship cannot simultaneously exist. This theorem was published by Kenneth Arrow in _Social Choice and Individual Values_ (1951). The final video can be found here: https://youtu.be/Bz0TIy9YRXc
